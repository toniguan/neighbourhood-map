# Neighborhood Map Project
___
This project is part of Udacity FrontEnd Nanodegree program. The Neighborhood map application shows a map of San Francisco area with bunch of museums. The locations are highlighted on the map and third-party data about those locations can be browsed in various ways. React is used to developed the codebase.  Google Maps API is used to render the map. Foursquare API provides the locations and location details.  I also use Axios API to help with asynchronous XMLHttpRequest.
